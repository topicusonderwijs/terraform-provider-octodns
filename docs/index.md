# octodns Provider

**Warning**: This provider is still a work-in-progress so use at your own risk

This provider allows you to modify your OctoDNS zone yaml files within a github repo,
and can handle multiple zone directories within one git repo by defining multiple scopes

For github authentication you can use a personal access token (PAT) or use the [Github Cli](https://cli.github.com) to provide a token.
If you don't have `gh` in your $PATH, you can point to the executable using the GH_PATH environment variable.   
*Example*: ```GH_PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/gh terraform plan```

note: This provider can only manage records within existing zone files, it **cannot** manage/create zone files or alter the OctoDNS config.

Also this provider does not run OctoDNS after a modification, so you need your own automation for that like the OctoDNS github action

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "octodns" {
  github_access_token = "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  github_org          = "example_org"
  github_repo         = "dns_repo"

  scope {
    path = "zones"
  }

}


provider "octodns" {
  github_access_token = "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  github_org          = "example_org"
  github_repo         = "dns_repo"

  scope {
    path = "internal/zones"
  }
  scope {
    name = "external"
    path = "external/zones"
  }

}
```
