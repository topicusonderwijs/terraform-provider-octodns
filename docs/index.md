# octodns Provider

**Warning**: This provider is still a work-in-progress so use on your own risk

This provider allows you to modify your OctoDNS zone yaml files within a github repo,
and can handle multiple zone directories within one git repo by defining multiple scopes

note: This provider can only manage records within existing zone files, it **cannot** manage/create zone files alter octodns config
also this provider does not run octodns after a modification, so you need your own automation for that like the octodns github action

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "octodns" {
  github_access_token = "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  github_org          = "example_org"
  github_repo         = "dns_repo"

  scope {
    path = "zones"
  }

}


provider "octodns" {
  github_access_token = "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  github_org          = "example_org"
  github_repo         = "dns_repo"

  scope {
    path = "internal/zones"
